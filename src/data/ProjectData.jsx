      "What is Kong?":
        "Kong helps foster the love for nature by gamifying plant identification. When user uploads or takes a photo of a plant, MyPlantnet identifies it, OpenAI API provides information about the plant, and StabilityAI API generates a Pok√©mon-like illustration. The identified plant's illustration and information are then added to the user's collection.",
      "Why is Kong necessary?":
        "According to the World Economic Forum, almost 8 out of 10 children do not recognize common plants like an oak leaf or a bluebell. In a world where climate crisis is worse than ever, it is essential that we don't forget about the very basics: fostering a culture where we love and appreciate nature and have empathy towards the environment.",
